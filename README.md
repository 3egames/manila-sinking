# manila-sinking
An online survival boardgame developed using VueJS. This game draws heavy inspiration from Gamewright's Forbidden Island (https://gamewright.com/product/Forbidden-Island). While core play mechanics remain the same, several thematic elements have been rewritten and simplified. If you liked this game then We advice you to support the original version by going to their website and buying the game.
